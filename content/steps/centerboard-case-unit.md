## The Unit
{{< step >}}
The is the centerboard, shown assembled from Parts 14, 14i, 14ii, and 14iii.  I found the instructions, and the part labeling for my kit to be somewhat confusing.
Before gluing anything, be sure to coat the case interior with epoxy and check that the centerboard travels freely through the open slot.

## Bevel and Size Check
{{< step >}}
Bevel one end to the same angle as the hull where the centerboard slot is located.  Either a belt sander, or table-top sander is very useful for this task.

Just as a check, the opening should be about 15 3/8 inches.
