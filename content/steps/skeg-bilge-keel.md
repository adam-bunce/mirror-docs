## Bilge Pieces
{{< step >}}
The bilge pieces are installed by locating the blocks that hold the side panels to the hull.  Use the measurements for installing these blocks to locate the points where you should install the bilge pieces.  The aluminum keel band can also be seen in this photo, which is installed on both sides of the centerboard opening.
