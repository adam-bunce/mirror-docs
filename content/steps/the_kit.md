## The Mirror Kit  

{{< step >}}
The Mirror kit arrives in a crated box, with the wood carefully wrapped, and various bags of hardware. Carefully inventory this hardware, but do not open individual hardware bags  until you need them.

My kit was shipped by truck from Toronto,  Canada to Minneapolis, MN, and arrived in two crated boxes - a  larger one with nearly all the wood and hardware, and a long, narrow one  containing the mast pieces and gunwales.

## Epoxy
{{< step >}}
A quick word about epoxy. I used "West System" epoxy products, and I have nothing but good to say
about them. Don't skimp - buy the pumps for each of the cans. They automatically mix at the proper
1:5 ratio. The can on the left was called "205 Hardener", which I used when the garage was a little 
cooler. The can on the right is the 105 Resin. I purchased a gallon of resin, and the matching
amount of hardener. I ended up returning to the store later for more.

Get about 50
(or more) of the disposable resin brushes. You will need lots of
these! If you are pre-coating your wood (highly recommended!), buy some foam
rollers - lots of them. Home Depot also had some neat small square
disposable mixing trays. I went through about 20 of these. They
were about 75cents(UPDATE HERE) each.
