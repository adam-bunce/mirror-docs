## Two People, Or One Really Long Clamp
{{< step >}}
The instructions again say this is a "two-person" job.  This can also be accomplished using a really long clamp.

{{< step >}}
As you twist on more copper wire, move your clamp down.  You will also notice to the far right of the picture,
there is a saw-horse being used to support the side panels.

## Stitching
{{< step >}}
As you work your way towards the aft transom, you will have to pre-position your copper wire into the drilled holes.
Bend the copper wire into a U-shape for the remaining 5 holes and slowly, push the sides towards the hull bottom.

Eventually, one side is completed.  The boat will be very twisted at this point, but will un-twist once the other side is completed.

## Result
{{< step >}}
Here is a pic now with BOTH sides attached with twisted wire.  Ready to put in the water...well, maybe not quite yet.  But at this stage, call the wife out and tell her it is starting to look like a real boat now.
You will notice that I STILL have the fore transom installed incorrectly.  YES, it was a real pain taking it out, and re-installing it later.
