## Floor battens
{{< step >}}
Position the battens, as per the instructions.  Their exact location
is not critical (unlike the glue blocks, whose positioning IS
critical).  Make a VERY LIGHT mark at the corners of the batten
locations.  (I made very heavy marks, and found them difficult to
sand out later!)  As suggested in the instructions, I only prepared
the battens at this stage and drilled the holes.
I installed them later, once the panels were stitched,
and the curvature of the hull established.

## Close Up's
{{< step >}}
Once you have positioned the batten, drill holes carefully through the hull.
"Carefully" means so as not to splinter the hull plywood, leaving damage which
will be visible from the outside and require filler when finishing.

{{< step >}}
The kit directions specify that only three screws are inserted from the inside per batten.
The purpose of these is to position & hold the battens in place while you are driving the hull-side screws.
Countersink these interior screws.  Also, round off the batten ends as shown.
If you find yourself sailing barefoot or wearing only sandals, sharp corners will hurt!

## Reminder
I only prepared the battens at this stage.  No screws we attached, or battens glued, until the hull was wired together and the panels had assumed their final curvature.
