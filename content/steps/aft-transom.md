## Starting Point
{{< step >}}
This picture shows the correct orientation of the aft transom.
The photo in the text instructions does not show this piece, which
(in my kit) came pre-assembled with the engraved serial number facing the interior of the boat.

## Aft Stitch
{{< step >}}
As with the hull panels, 3/32" holes are drilled.  Note that the transom sits
INSIDE the panels (as is also emphasized in the instructions).

This picture shows some detail of the aft transom (Part 7)
as it is to be lined up with the hull panels (Part 1).
Note the slight bevel of the bottom hull.
