## The Stitch
{{< step >}}
The bottom of the boat, both panels "1-2", are now stitched together using copper wire.
The picture at the right shows "1-2" completely stitched.

This is accomplished by inserting the cut copper wire through the pre-drilled holes,
and with pliers, twisting the wire.  Only twist the wire one to one and a half turns leaving the
joint quite loose at this time.  They will be tightened later.
If you tighten them now, the plywood will break (trust me on this one).

## Prepping Wire
{{< step >}}
When cutting the copper wire, I set my small square to the required 2 1/2" length.
This made cutting the wire quick as the measurement was "automatic".

I kept all my pieces of copper wire in one of the epoxy/paint trays mentioned earlier.

## Result
{{< step >}}
Once wired together and unfolded, parts "1-2", should look like this, which is pretty much the same as the photo shown with the text instructions.
