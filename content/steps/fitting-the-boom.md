The boom has various assemblies attached at each end, and some in the middle.  Depending on what you have ordered and chosen to install, your boom may look slightly different from mine.

This is a close-up of my boom gooseneck.  (The tack-eye installed at the top of the boom is an optional item).

The kicking strap block is a small piece of wood that is installed on the TOP of the boom.  It functions to hold the kicking strap (aka the boom vang) in place on the boom.

This picture shows both the kicking strap block and gooseneck, in their proper orientation.  The low end of the kicking strap block is toward the gooseneck.

This picture shows the boom partially rigged.  Some optional parts were purchased to create this set up.

This photo shows the aft end of the boom completely rigged with both the outhaul and downhaul assemblies.  This particular assembly allows for a 2:1 ratio when adjusting the clew-outhaul.

Same assembly, different camera angle.
A 2:1 purchase is very useful for adjusting the outhaul when sailing.
