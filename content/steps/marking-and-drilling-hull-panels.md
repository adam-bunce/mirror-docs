## Drill Holes

![drilling holes](/images/steps/marking-drilling-hull-panels/boat_drill_hull.png)
Draw a guideline, and mark-off positions for your 3/32 drill holes as per the instructions.  

Sorry, but this is my only picture for this step.  Just make sure that you align your joined 1-2 panels carefully, and hold them together firmly.  I used clamps during the drilling.  

The drilling of holes on the side panels (5-6) involves a different technique.
