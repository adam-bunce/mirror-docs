## Cutting Excess Wire
{{< step >}}
I found using regular wire cutting pliers simply too hard on the hands. For the hundreds of wires that you are going to clip, invest in one of these "horizontal blade" high leverage wire cutters.  They cut the copper like butter.

I tried using the "iron soled hand plane", but found this method to work very well for at least getting the bulk of the copper off.

## Sanding Seam

Once the bulk of the wires were removed, I used my belt sander and simply sanded off the remains.

The picture at the left shows the copper wires sanded flush to the hull.  In addition, you are also sanding off the hull edges for a smooth finish.
