## Mistakes

{{< step >}}
Study the diagram for the Glue Block layout carefully. If the blocks are fixed in the wrong location/orientation, the seats & decking will not install correctly later.  The picture at the left shows what happens when you INCORRECTLY join Parts 1 and 2.  Notice that the butt strap is not central to  the joint  This picture shows the blocks placed, but not yet glued. (This is when I discovered my error!)

I used my router (yep, another useful power tool) to "grind out" a
portion of the butt-strap.  Otherwise, the hull and bulkheads would
not assemble correctly later.  See, everyone makes mistakes!
Try to correct them as soon as possible after they happen.
If I had simply continued and stitched the hull pieces together it
would have been very difficult to fix this mistake.
In the end, the area marked "needs fill" was simply left "as is".

## Glued Down + Bevel

{{< step >}}
The placement, and orientation of the blocks is very important.
Notice from the picture at the right which side of the blocks have
the bevel.  The picture above is very large as I wanted to show the
detail in the two insets in the lower corners.  This is VERY
important.

{{< step >}}
The 6mm gap between the blocks and the butt strap is important.
Later, a bulkhead edge will be inserted there.
Note the bevel again.

Again, the purpose of this picture was to emphasize the bevel.  It points to the center of the boat.
