# Mirror Theme

disclaimer: _this theme was made for the mirrordocs website and not really anything else
it's not very extensible and the first theme i've made so it's probably not
optimal :) <3 (if you're reading this go find a different theme lmao)_

## otherwise:
main navigation title depends on what `title = 'title here'` is set to in config.toml

other nav links depend on what content folders are named

every folder's _index.md turns into a list page, linking to all of the content pages for
that content section (obvi you can override w/ layout: other_layout)

all content pages are formatted the same, use shortcodes to customise
